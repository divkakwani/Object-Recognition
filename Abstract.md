# Object Recognition

Object recognition is a central problem in artificial intelligence. This problem has lingered in computer science for a long time and yet is not completely solved. We, in our project, aim to study and develop a system for object recognition using existing and novel techniques.

The task of object recognition is a long and complex process. An image goes through several intermediate phases before the information of the objects contained in the image is extracted. The sequence of operation on an image is as follows :

* Image preprocessing
* Edge detection
* Segmentation
* Pattern matching

The above points are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.

### Image Preprocessing

### Segmentation
